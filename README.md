### Training Dynamics & Model Robustness

#### Loss Curves

The model achieves stable and effective loss minimization, as visualized in the training curves below:
<img src="static/images/loss.jpg" alt="AP" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Total Loss steadily decreases, indicating smooth convergence.
- Component Losses (loss_rpn_cls, loss_rpn_loc, loss_box_reg, loss_cls) all drop and stabilize, confirming effective learning in both region proposal and final classification stages.

#### Classification Performance:

Final Accuracy: 98.66% (cls_accuracy)
Low False Negative Rate: 2.69% - crucial for comprehensive clover detection
High Precision: 97.31% (fg_cls_accuracy) - minimizes false clover identifications

## Installation 🛠️

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is through Docker, which handles all dependencies and configurations automatically.

#### Prerequisites

- Install Docker Desktop
- Prepare the following files (provided in the zip package clover-detect-docker.zip):
  - clover-detect.tar (pre-built Docker image)
  - docker-compose.yaml
  - schema.sql
- Extract all files to a directory on your computer

**Important Note**: If you cannot find the `clover-detect.tar` file, make sure file extensions are visible in your file explorer settings.
<img src="static/images/show_file_extensions.jpg" alt="Enable File Extensions in Windows Explorer" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Setup and Run

1. Run Docker Desktop APP
2. Navigate to the directory containing the files
3. Open a terminal(PowerShell or Bash) and enter the following commands to build and run the Docker container:

```bash
# Load the pre-built image (it takes time)
docker load -i clover-detect.tar

# Start the application using docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

<img src="static/images/setupDocker.jpg" alt="Setup Docker Container" style="zoom:67%;" />

After the initial setup, you can access the application through typing the address into the browser's navigation bar with: http://localhost:7860 or simply use the Docker Desktop to start or close the container. If you accidentally delete the container, re-enter the above commands to rebuild it. ( It a bit takes time for the web page to first load)

#### Cleaning Up Docker Resources

When you're done using the application:

1. Stop the container using Docker Desktop or with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. To thoroughly remove all associated resources (images, volumes, and networks):
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a --volumes
   ```

**Note**: Simply clicking the "Delete" button in Docker Desktop may not completely remove all resources. The command above ensures complete cleanup.

### Option 2: Local Development

For continued development or model training, setting up a local environment is recommended.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Git
- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- CUDA 11.7+ (for GPU version only)

#### Setup Steps

1. **Extract the Project**

   ```bash
   # If using the ZIP package:
   unzip clover-detect.zip -d clover-detect
   cd clover-detect
   ```

2. **Create Environment Using Conda**

   ```bash
   # For CPU version
   conda env create -f environmentCPU.yml

   # For GPU version
   conda env create -f environmentGPU.yml
   ```

3. **Activate the Environment**

   ```bash
   # For CPU version
   conda activate CloverCPU

   # For GPU version
   conda activate Clover
   ```

4. **Install SAM2 from Local Directory**
   Installing from the local folder ensures project structure and path configurations remain consistent, preventing configuration file errors.

   ```bash
   cd app/object_detection_and_SAM/sam2_model_info/sam2
   pip install -e .
   cd ../../../../
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash

   # Windows
   ./run.cmd

   # Linux/macOS
   ./run.sh

   # Or directly with Flask
   python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=7860
   ```

## Configuration ⚙️

1. **Model Paths** (`app/config/paths.py`)
   Model paths are all configured in `app/config/paths.py`. The default configuration should work if you're using the provided unzipped project structure:

```python
FASTER_RCNN_WEIGHTS = "app/object_detection_and_SAM/weights/model_0001099.pth"
SAM_WEIGHTS = "app\object_detection_and_SAM\sam2_model_info\sam2\checkpoints\sam2.1_hiera_large.pt"
SAM2_CONFIG = "app/object_detection_and_SAM\sam2_model_info\sam2\sam2\sam2.1_hiera_l.yaml"
```

2. **Database Setup** (`app/dbFile/config.cnf`)

When running locally, you need to set up a local MySQL server.

```ini
[database]
host=localhost
user=your_username
password=your_password
database=your_db_name
```

## Usage Guide 🚀

**Web Interface Workflow**

1. Upload pasture image (JPG/JPEG)
2. Review detected clover plots
3. Adjust bounding boxes if needed
4. Add calibration marker (optional)
5. Submit for SAM2 analysis
6. View results: hover to quickly locate the corresponding plot in the image
7. Export results by click "Export CSV"

#### Data storage Path Configuration

Configure persistent storage paths for your data:

For local environments: After setting up your local environment, you can access path settings through the "Paths" button in the top-right corner of the Index (home) page to modify local storage paths.

The Docker environment defaults to Windows as the host operating system and mounts the corresponding folders in C:/CloverData. If using macOS or Linux, modify the docker-compose.yaml file as shown below, then rebuild and run the Docker container.

| OS      | Default Path               | Configuration Method                    |
| ------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `C:\CloverData`            | Default settings in docker-compose.yaml |
| macOS   | `/Users/Shared/CloverData` | Edit docker-compose.yaml                |
| Linux   | `/data/CloverData`         | Edit docker-compose.yaml                |

To modify the paths for macOS or Linux, edit the volume mappings in `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  # For Windows (default)
  - C:/CloverData/uploads:/app/uploads
  - C:/CloverData/outputs:/app/outputs
  - C:/CloverData/exports_excel:/app/exports_excel

  # For macOS (uncomment and comment Windows paths)
  # - /Users/Shared/CloverData/uploads:/app/uploads
  # - /Users/Shared/CloverData/outputs:/app/outputs
  # - /Users/Shared/CloverData/exports_excel:/app/exports_excel

  # For Linux (uncomment and comment Windows paths)
  # - /data/CloverData/uploads:/app/uploads
  # - /data/CloverData/outputs:/app/outputs
  # - /data/CloverData/exports_excel:/app/exports_excel
```

Apply the changes by following these steps:

```bash
docker-compose down  # Stop and remove the existing containers
docker-compose up --build -d  # Rebuild and start the container with updated volume mappings
```

Key benefits:

- Data persists beyond container lifecycle
- Direct host filesystem access
- Better I/O performance

## Model Training 🧠

To train or fine-tune the models on new dataset:

| Script            | Command                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Training     | `python app/object_detection_and_SAM/train.py`              | CPU-friendly basic training                                                                                                                   |
| Enhanced Training | `python app/object_detection_and_SAM/train_augmentation.py` | Requires higher GPU performance but leverages OpenCV to expand the sample size, improving model generalization and reducing overfitting risk. |
